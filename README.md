## Deck Manager

This is a Miro extension to use shapes, sticky notes and images as playing cards or dice.
Developed by Azahar Games, a board game publisher in Colombia. We use this extension to design and test board games in Miro.

The app is currently a Beta.

### Functionality

- Shuffle: select multiple elements or groups of elements at once and shuffle them.
- Flip: group to elements first. Then use this bottom so those elements are flipped, as if you were flipping a playing card.
- Stack: Select multiple elements and click this buttom so all are centered on a single point, building a deck
- Random Pick: Select multiple elements and click the bottom to pick one at random and send it to front.
- Spread: select a min and max range and click the button to spread all elements randomly in the space.
- Roll: Stack multiple shapes (not groups) and click this button to emulate the rolling of a dice: one element will get to be on top at random.


## Groups
To build a "card" we recomend grouping only two elements, one for the cover of the card and one for the front face. If you can an element with multiple shapes grouped together, we recommend copying the elements as an image and then using the image version to crate the card. While some functionalities might work with grouped elements, we recommend making a copy of your work before testing the extension.

Miro API doesn't allow to move or reorder "group" elements, making this a workaround to make it work.
