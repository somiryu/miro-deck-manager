## Deck Manager

This is a Miro extension to use shapes, sticky notes and images as playing cards or dice.
Developed by Azahar Games, a board game publisher in Colombia. We use this extension to design and test board games in Miro.

### Functionality

- Shuffle: select multiple elements or groups of elements at once and shuffle them.
- Flip: group to elements first. Then use this bottom so those elements are flipped, as if you were flipping a playing card.
- Stack: Select multiple elements and click this buttom so all are centered on a single point, building a deck
- Random Pick: Select multiple elements and click the bottom to pick one at random and send it to front.
- Spread: select a min and max range and click the button to spread all elements randomly in the space.
- Roll: Stack multiple shapes (not groups) and click this button to emulate the rolling of a dice: one element will get to be on top at random.
